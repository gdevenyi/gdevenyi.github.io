title: The Two Cultures (of Reddit)
---

The two cultures is an influential 1959 book discussing the rift between the humanities and the sciences, how they talk differently, how they hold different values and how they rarely interact. I don't suppose to have something new to say about this philosophical and cultural discourse, but I'll happily steal the title to discuss an organization with a jekyl and hide culture, [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com).

Reddit, as its byline claims is "the front page of the internet." Functionally, its a hybrid link-sharing and discussion board system. Reddit's main innovation was the introduction of the upvote/downvote system, "democratizing" both the popularity of links, and the comments on those links. These links can be posted in user-created and moderated topic-centric "subreddits" which develop their own rules, discourse and cultures.

When a random internet denizen navigates to Reddit, what do they see? They see what are called the default subreddits. These subreddits are selected by the reddit administrators through an internal process, occasionally, they explain their choices on their [admin blog](http://www.redditblog.com/). These default subreddits receive massive traffic as do the links that are posted there. These subreddits are also the default subscriptions for new users.
