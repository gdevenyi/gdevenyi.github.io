If writing is hard, writing about yourself is doubly so. I'm an engineer(ing graduate) or at least, I was. I'm a experimental physicist, until I graduated and found out that academic jobs in the field are a craps shoot and only hedge funds want to hire physicists in the real world. Now I've come back to my first love, computing, and I've been lucky enough to find an academic job doing research in computational neuroscience. I write code to process MRI data, I teach students the best practices in scientific computing.

Other things about me, that you'll have to wait for another time.
